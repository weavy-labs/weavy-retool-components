## Weavy components

### Configure Weavy

Set up two configuration variables for environment url and Api key in you [Settings > Configuration variables](https://docs.retool.com/org-users/guides/config-vars#create-configuration-variables). You may specify different environment/api key for staging and production.

- WEAVY_URL: *Your Environment URL*
- WEAVY_APIKEY: *Your wys_*** API key **Note: this should be set as secret**.

### Set up workflow and queries

The queries will provide your apps and components with user tokens for Weavy.

#### Upload the `WeavyRetoolWorkFlow.json`

- Go to *Workflows* in Retool.
- Click **Create New** and select **From JSON**.
- Choose to **Upload a file** and select [queries/WeavyRetoolWorkflow.json](./queries/WeavyRetoolWorkflow.json) in the modal and then **Create workflow**.
- All settings are already included, so all you have to do is Deploy (up to the right).
  - If the Deploy button is disabled, it's either already deployed (look for the text Latest version deployed), or some of the settings might not have loaded correctly - refresh, and it should be working.
  - Any message about no triggers configured can be ignored.

#### Use the workflow in an app query

To activate and use the workflow your Retool app, you need to add a query that is using the workflow.

- Open your Retool app editor and go to the **<> Code** panel.
- Click on **ï¼‹ Add query** and choose Import Workflow.
- Name the query `getWeavyToken`.
- Select **Workflow** and choose **WeavyRetoolWorkflow**.
  
  The Workflow parameters should be defaulted with the data shown below. Otherwise you can set it as *raw* data.

  ```json
  { 
    "uid" : {{ current_user.sid }}, 
    "fullname" : {{ current_user.fullName }}, 
    "email" : {{ current_user.email }}, 
    "avatar" : {{ current_user.profilePhotoUrl }}
  }
  ```

- **Save** the query and give it a **run** to try it out!

### Using weavy components

Drag'n'drop components into your app. You may have to configure `uid` on any contextual components. The components follow your theme settings, but you may also override any theme settings.

### Setting up notification events

Drag the **Weavy Notification Events** component into you app. The component must be present all the time to work.

#### Configure notification toasts

* Add an *Event handler* for the `Notification` event. 
  - Set the event to **Show notification**.
  - Set the Title to `{{ self.notificationTitle }}`
  - Set the description to `{{ self.notificationTitle }}`.

#### Configure token refreshing

Since the notification events is always present it's suitable for handling refreshing of user tokens when needed.

* Set an *Event handler* for the `Refresh token` event.
  - Set the event to **Control query**.
  - Select the `getWeavyToken` query.
  - Set the *Method* to **Trigger**.

#### Set up a button with badge for unread notifications

You can connect the `notificationCount` property of the *Weavy Notification Events* component with a badge.

* Add a *Button group* component. This is very suitable for displaying unread notifications.
  - Add a button with any desired icon.
  - Set the label to `{{ String(weavyNotificationEvents1.notificationCount || '') }}` (assuming your notification component is called *weavyNotificationEvents1*). The label will be automatically hidden when the count is `0`.

### Setting up Notifications

Add the *Weavy Notifications* component to your app.

#### Configure navigation

To set up navigation when clicking notification items in the Notifications component, you must first [Customize app URLs](https://docs.retool.com/apps/guides/customization/customize-app-urls) in *App settings* > *Page settings* your Retool app, to be able to use deep links. This can be a bit challenging if you haven't done it before. Make sure there is a way to navigate to all the places where you are using Weavy components. Once this is done, the Weavy components will automatically encode these page variables into their own *uid*.

* Add an *Event handler* for the `Navigation` event.
  - Set the event to **Run script**.
  - Set the script to
    ```js
    utils.openApp(retoolContext.appUuid, weavyNotifications1.navigationParams)
    ```
* Optionally any additional *Event handler* for the `Navigation` event to do additional things upon navigation, such as closing a *Drawer* for instance.
* Add an *Event handler for the `Open messenger` event.
 - Set the event to do whatever you need to show the messenger, such as opening a drawer.
